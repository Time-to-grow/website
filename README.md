# Time to grow

This is a landscaping business website, built in Typescript, with ReactJS. It uses [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to hold the website media, and content. <br/>
The styling is done with [Material UI](https://mui.com/) styled components. 

## Getting started

- Run `npm install` to install all deps
- To start the app; `npm run dev` 
- The app should appear on `localhost:3000`
- The application will complain if the formatting doesn't fit with the requirements. To fix lint errors, run `npm run lint:fix` to resolve this
